# Octave_Matlab
Collection of Matlab/Octave projects 

These projects were originally written in Matlab for an introductory graduate course in machine learning. They have been updated and tested with gnu Octave, running on an Ubuntu 20.04 system. The |.html| files were 'published' from |.m| files that were generally written as notebooks that include main code with comments as well as some discussion of the data science involved.
