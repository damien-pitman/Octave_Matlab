# Octave_Matlab
Collection of Matlab/Octave projects originating from a machine learning course at Montana State University. The code was written in Matlab and updated in gnu Octave, running on an Ubuntu 20.04 system. 

'my-functions' were written in a notebook style that includes main code with comments as well as some discussion of the data science involved. 

'helper-functions' are necessary for programs in 'my-functions'. They were provided by the instructor of the course, Dominique Zosso. These are included to help any interested reader understand what is happening behind the code in 'my-functions'.

'html' contains published versions of code in 'my-functions'. 

Note: This repsitory does not contain code that can be run as is. You would need the data files. The data files are not provided because this repository is only meant to be a demonstration of some of my work in data science and GitHub doesn't like the size of the data files.
